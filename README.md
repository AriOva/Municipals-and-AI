# Municipals-and-AI

Municipals and vitality created by local enterprises

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Support municipalities in decision making to support enterprises that create the optimal impact on vitality of municipal, like increased tax income and supporting people to stay in district.

## Background

Municipals and small cities are focusing on maintaining their vitality. In this project, vitality is restricted to enterprises and number employed residents and tax income from enterprises and employed residents. Municipals wants to support the enterprises that have best impact on vitality and fit best in municipal strategy. Should municipal try to attract major enterprises (like big customer centers) to come to start new unit in municipal or should it support local business and start-ups. What industry is the best choice? Travel, wood industry, agriculture, services, or what? What investments have the biggest impact?

Municipals are challenging with the aging of their residents. Young people are moving to major cities and capital areas where there are more opportunities to study, work and bring up the family. This project could be part of knowledge-based management development currently taking place in municipals.

## How is it used?

Solution is used annually as part of budgetary planning in municipals. It makes political decision-making more knowledge-based. Solution will be used also in monitoring the impacts of decisions and making corrective actions by municipals. Solution can be part of learning process where municipals learn more about the factors that affect on enterprise success in their district. This also helps enterprises to understand how municipal is able to support them to be more successful.

## Data sources and AI methods

Currently most of the data is provided by Statistics Finland. It collects information from different data sources managed by other government institutions, like tax authorities and company registration, and municipals. Unfortunately the data is rather old for strategy and scenario work, decision-making and follow-ups. From enterprises, data is not directly collected.

## Challenges

The solution is focusing on enterprise vitality only. Vitality in municipals and their residents include many other aspects too, like health care and education.

## What next?

The solution is part of the learning process, where municipals will better understand which factors attract companies to come to the district and which factors improve the conditions for local companies. The number of variables and coefficients will increase. More online data will be needed in the future.

## Acknowledgments

The inspiration for this solution came from Knowledge-based management projects for three municipals in Finland. I was part of the team to define current state and vision of Knowledge-management in these municipals. I was interviewing many key persons and during these discussions I got the idea.
